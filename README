Instructions for running the program:

1. Download all files, making sure they are under the same project.
2. Run main.cpp
   Notes: 
      When running main.cpp, both the function called menu() that corresponds to module 4 part 1 and the largestOfThreeNum() function for module 4 part 2 will run
      If you want to run one and not the other, feel free to common one of those functions out. 

3. The code for the functions corresponding to each part of Module 4 is in the file "Module 4_CIS25.cpp".
   Notes:
      For the debugging part of the assignment, there are comments on what was wrong with some of the original code.
