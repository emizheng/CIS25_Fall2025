This code shows that different levels of the same object will do different thinigs depending on which level of the class hierarchy is being accessed. For instance, choosing to access the inventory manager level leads to a different output than accessing the customer level. The outputs are modeled as if the levels are people working in a grocery store. 
Run main.cpp to see the print out for each level of management. 
The M10.h file contains all the class creation. These are the classes that main.cpp accesses.
